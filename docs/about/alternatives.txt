general Python layer, and other projects focus on more specific needs.


**********
For Django
**********

django-health-check
===================

`django-health-check`_ provides health checks for the `Django`_ framework.

Health checks instances need to be registered in order to be loaded. The
registration is performed in a similar manner than admin classes of Django's
builtin administration application.

`hospital` is inspired by unittest and related tools, and so is discovery and
loading.

django-doctor
=============

`django-doctor`_ provides health checks for the `Django`_ framework.

`hospital`'s features, such as :class:`~hospital.core.HealthCheck`, were first
introduced in `django-doctor`. But some features were not specific to `Django`,
and `hospital` was created. See https://github.com/funkbit/django-doctor/pull/2
and https://github.com/funkbit/django-doctor/pull/4.

django-smoketest
================

`django-smoketest`_ provides health checks for the `Django`_ framework.
